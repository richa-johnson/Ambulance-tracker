#  ResqRoute â€“ Real-Time Ambulance Tracker

**ResqRoute** is a real-time ambulance tracking and booking platform developed during our internship at **DITS, Kannur**. It addresses the emergency service gap by connecting patients to the nearest available ambulances â€” both government and private â€” based on real-time location and medical needs.

---

##  Problem Statement

The 108 ambulance service in India is primarily limited to government vehicles. In critical situations, patients often struggle to find private ambulances promptly. **ResqRoute** was created to solve this issue by building a platform that unifies all ambulance services, enabling quick access and reliable tracking.

##  Features

- **Proximity-Based Sorting**: Uses OpenStreetMap & OSRM to calculate real-time distances.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter ambulances by:
  - Facilities (Oxygen, ICU, Ventilator)

- **Multi-Patient Booking**: Users can book for multiple patients in one go.
- **Role-Based Dashboards**:

  - **Driver**: Manage incoming bookings and availability status.
  - **Admin**: Add/edit ambulances, monitor system, and manage users.
